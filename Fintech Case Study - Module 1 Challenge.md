# Flutterwave

Flutterwave is a billing payment and ecommerce fintech company incorporated in 2016 by **Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Olugbenga Agboola, and Adeleke Adekoya** Flutterwave is headquartered in San Francisco, California but has operations in more than 7 African countries processing in excess of [^1]500k payment transactions daily and currently estimated to be worth about $3B [^2]

The motivation behind the company was fragmented payments issues in Africa (Nigeria as case-in-point) and difficulty in remitting to foreign currency.

However, its services now include a full suite of financial solutions that range from credit/loans solutions to ecommerce and venture capital for start-ups.

Fluterwave streamlines the process and allows for seamless services both for the business and customers.

Flutter wave also created a product for individuals that offers virtual credit cards in dollars with which individuals can make international purchases. Flutterwave has since grown into a suite of ecommerce and banking solutions that looks to streamline cross-border transactions.[^4]

The main metric for success specifically for the point-of-sale services has to be the number of transactions completed on the platform. While the value of said transaction can also be an indication of success. The confidence with the security available with the technology is also indicative of investments, partnerships and customer base.
